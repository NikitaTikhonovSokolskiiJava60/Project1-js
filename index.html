            <img src="images/dodge_viper.jpeg" data-alt-text="dodge_viper" data-detailed-text="Dodge Viper. The Dodge Viper underwent a major redesign in 2002, courtesy of DaimlerChrysler's Street and Racing Technology group, taking cues from the Dodge Viper GTS-R concept presented in 2000. The new Viper SRT-10, which replaced both the GTS and the RT/10, was heavily restyled with sharp, angled bodywork. The engine's displacement was increased to 8.3 L; 505.6 cu in (8,285 cc), which, with other upgrades, increased the maximum power output to 500 hp (507 PS; 373 kW) at 5,600 rpm and 525 lb⋅ft (712 N⋅m) of torque at 4,200 rpm. Despite the power increase, the engine weight was reduced to about 500 lb (230 kg). The chassis was also improved, becoming more rigid and weighing approximately 80 lb (36 kg) less than the previous model." class = "cars-image">
            <img src="images/jaguar_xj.jpg" data-alt-text="jaguar_xj" data-detailed-text="Jaguar XJR. The XJR is powered by the supercharged version of the 4.0 L V8. It is also equipped with sport suspension, wider wheels and tyres, and matte-black exterior window trim, except in the United States market, where the XJR was given chrome window frames and rain gutters. Like the Sport model, the XJR has a body-coloured radiator grille surround; it is with a stainless-steel mesh insert rather than the normal vanes. Other exterior touches include the XJR rear badging and larger exhaust outlets." class = "cars-image">
            <img src="images/jeep_grand_cherokee.jpeg" data-alt-text="jeep_grand_cherokee" data-detailed-text="Jeep Grand Cherokee. As before, the Trailhawk starts with the best off-road gear in the Jeep pantheon: the Quadra-Drive II four-wheel-drive system with its two-speed transfer case and Selec-Terrain dial, along with an electronically controlled limited-slip rear differential, hill-descent and -ascent control (HDC), a full gamut of skid plates, and Jeep’s nifty off-road app. The standard air springs can rise to provide up to 10.8 inches of ground clearance (0.4 inch more than any other air-spring-equipped Grand Cherokee) or lower the vehicle to ease ingress and egress. The rolling stock is no joke: Kevlar-reinforced 265/60R-18 Goodyear Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure all-terrain tires wrapped around aluminum wheels with matte-black inserts." class = "cars-image">

            <img src="images/volkswagen_phaeton.jpg" data-alt-text="volkswagen_phaeton" data-detailed-text="Volkswagen Phaeton W12. Compared to the Audi A8L 4.2 litre FSI quattro, the Phaeton is 545 lb (247 kg) heavier but is still competitive with the lighter A8 in most driving tests, due to the Phaeton's increased engine power (335 hp versus 330) and a shorter axle ratio (3.65:1 versus 3.32). However, the weight gives the Phaeton considerably worse acceleration and poorer fuel economy compared to the A8." class = "cars-image">
